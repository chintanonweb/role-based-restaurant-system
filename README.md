## What I Built

I built a comprehensive Restaurant Management System that addresses the common challenges faced by restaurants in managing their operations efficiently. The system provides a unified platform for administrators, chefs, and customers, streamlining the entire process from menu management to order fulfillment.

The key problems it solves include:
- Centralizing menu management and order processing
- Providing real-time communication between kitchen and front-end staff
- Offering customers an intuitive ordering experience
- Implementing role-based access control for security
- Managing inventory and tracking sales analytics

## My Journey

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges and learned valuable lessons:

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - Challenge: Managing complex state across multiple user roles and features
   - Solution: Implemented React Context with custom hooks for better state organization
   - Learning: The importance of proper state management architecture in large applications

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Challenge: Keeping order status and inventory synchronized
   - Solution: Used React's state management with localStorage for persistence
   - Learning: Effective strategies for handling real-time data updates

3. **Role-based Access Control**
   - Challenge: Implementing secure and flexible authorization
   - Solution: Integrated Permit.io for robust authorization management
   - Learning: The importance of separating authentication and authorization concerns

## Using Permit.io for Authorization

In this project, we used Permit.io's API-first approach for authorization. The implementation involved:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created a Permit.io account and project
   - Configured environment variables for Permit.io integration
   - Initialized the Permit client in our application

2. **Authorization Logic**
   - Implemented role-based access control using Permit.io's policies
   - Created custom hooks for permission checking
   - Integrated authorization checks throughout the application

## API-First Authorization

The project implements an API-first authorization approach using Permit.io:

1. **Authorization Architecture**
   - Centralized permission management through Permit.io's dashboard
   - Defined clear authorization policies for each user role
   - Implemented fine-grained access control at the API level

2. **Key Benefits**
   - Scalable and maintainable authorization logic
   - Consistent access control across all endpoints
   - Easy policy updates without code changes
   - Real-time policy enforcement

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Used Permit.io's SDK for policy enforcement
   - Implemented middleware for API route protection
   - Created reusable hooks for permission checking in components
